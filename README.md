# Advertising Budget Allocation Optimization using Snowflake, Snowpark, and Streamlit

This project aims to optimize advertising budget allocation using data engineering, machine learning, and interactive visualization techniques within the Snowflake data platform. It leverages Snowpark for Python to process and analyze data, Snowflake's ML capabilities for model training, and Streamlit for creating an interactive web application to visualize and predict advertising ROI based on budget allocations.


## Project Structure

#### 1.Data Engineering: 
Utilizes Snowflake and Snowpark for loading, transforming, and automating data preparation tasks such as campaign spend and monthly revenue data.

#### 2.Machine Learning: 
Implements Linear Regression using Snowpark ML for predicting revenue based on advertising budgets, with model logging into Snowflake's Model Registry for reusability.

#### 3.Streamlit Application: 
Develops a user-friendly interface using Streamlit to input budget allocations, visualize predictions, and save user interactions back to Snowflake.
